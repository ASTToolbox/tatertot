  <h1>BlueBot TOS</h1>
  Content that you post using our Services is your content (so let’s refer to it
  as “Your Content”). We don’t make any claim to it, which includes anything you
  post using our Services (like shop names, profile pictures, listing photos,
  listing descriptions, reviews, comments, videos, usernames, etc.). A.
  Responsibility for Your Content. You understand that you are solely
  responsible for Your Content. You represent that you have all necessary rights
  to all parts of Your Content and that you’re not infringing or violating any
  third party’s rights by posting it. B. Permission to Use Your Content. By
  posting Your Content through our Services, you grant Etsy a license to use it.
  We don’t claim any ownership to Your Content, but we have your permission to
  use it to help Etsy function and grow. That way, we won’t infringe any rights
  you have in Your Content and we can help promote it. For example, you
  acknowledge and agree Etsy may offer you or Etsy buyers promotions on the
  Site, from time to time, that may relate to your listings C. Rights You Grant
  Etsy. (Here’s the legalese version of the last section). By posting Your
  Content, you grant Etsy a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable,
  sub-licensable, perpetual license to use, display, edit, modify, reproduce,
  distribute, store, and prepare derivative works of Your Content. This allows
  us to provide the Services and to promote Etsy, your Etsy shop, or the
  Services in general, in any formats and through any channels, including across
  any Etsy Services, our partners, or third-party website or advertising medium.
  You agree not to assert any moral rights or rights of publicity against us for
  using Your Content. You also recognize our legitimate interest in using it, in
  accordance with the scope of this license, to the extent Your Content contains
  any personal information. That sounds like a lot, but it’s necessary for us to
  keep Etsy going. Consider these examples: if you upload a photo or video of a
  listing on your Etsy shop, we have permission to display it to buyers, and we
  can resize or enhance it so it looks good to a buyer using our mobile app; if
  you post a description in English, we can translate it into French so a buyer
  in Paris can learn the story behind your item; and if you post a beautiful
  photo or video of your latest handmade necklace, we can feature it– often
  along with your shop name and shop picture– on our homepage, in one of our
  blogs or even on a billboard to help promote your business and Etsy’s. D.
  Reporting Unauthorized Content. Etsy has great respect for intellectual
  property rights, and is committed to following appropriate legal procedures to
  remove infringing content from the Services. If content that you own or have
  rights to has been posted to the Services without your permission and you want
  it removed, please follow the steps listed in our Intellectual Property
  Policy. If Your Content is alleged to infringe another person’s intellectual
  property, we will take appropriate action, such as disabling it if we receive
  a report of infringement that complies with our policies, or terminating your
  account if you are found to be a repeat infringer. We’ll notify you if any of
  that happens. E. Inappropriate, False, or Misleading Content. This should be
  common sense, but there are certain types of content we don’t want posted on
  Etsy’s Services (for legal reasons or otherwise). You agree that you will not
  post any content that is abusive, threatening, defamatory, obscene, vulgar, or
  otherwise offensive or in violation of our Prohibited Items Policy, Community
  Policy, or any part of our Terms. You also agree not to post any content that
  is false and misleading or uses the Services in a manner that is fraudulent or
  deceptive.
